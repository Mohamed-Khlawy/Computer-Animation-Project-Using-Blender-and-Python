# The Betrayal Project

## Project Overview

The Betrayal Project is a visual storytelling project created using Blender and Python's Tkinter library. The project consists of two Blender scenes depicting a dramatic betrayal between two characters. The scenes are rendered individually, showcasing each character separately and a third scene displaying both characters in the same environment.

To enhance user interaction and experience, a Python GUI (Graphical User Interface) is implemented using Tkinter. The GUI allows users to view the rendered scenes with ease and provides functionality to restart the GUI or quit the application.

## Scenes

### 1. Individual Character Scenes
   - Scene 1: Character A throwing an arc.
   - Scene 2: Character B succumbing to the impact of the arc.

### 2. Combined Scene
   - Scene 3: Both characters in the same environment, capturing the betrayal moment.

## Python GUI

The Tkinter-based GUI offers a user-friendly interface to interact with the rendered scenes.

### Buttons

1. **Individual Scenes**
   - Displays two separate canvas windows for each character's individual scene.

2. **Whole Scene**
   - Displays a canvas window showcasing the third scene with both characters in the same environment.

3. **Restart GUI:**
   - Resets the GUI, allowing users to switch between viewing individual scenes and the combined scene without closing the application.

4. **Quit:**
   - Closes the Tkinter window and exits the application.

## How to Run the Betrayal Project

1. Ensure you have Blender installed to view the rendered scenes.
2. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
3. Run the Python script (`Betrayal Project.py`) to launch the Tkinter GUI.
4. Use the provided buttons to navigate through the scenes and interact with the project.

## Note

- Make sure to explore the scenes in sequential order to fully experience the betrayal story.
- Feel free to customize and enhance the project according to your preferences.
